My name is Maggie and Iâ€™m a Master's student at Erasmus University pursuing an MSc in Data Science and Marketing Analytics.

I'm a strategic thinker and creative problem-solver passionate about transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive real-world impact.

With a background in innovation, sustainability, and consumer research, Iâ€™ve worked across startups and global brands, leading projects that blend data analytics, strategy, and digital tools. I am currently a Venture Director at Enactus EUR, a startup incubator.

Outside of data, Iâ€™m always planning my next backpacking adventure and love capturing everyday moments through photography and design.
